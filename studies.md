# Self Studies

## Brief

In this lesson, we will be learning about the Big Data ecosystem and the evolution of data processing on distributed architectures. We will learn how to use Spark to process data in a distributed batch manner.

We will be running Spark on Google Colabatory (Colab). Colab is a free Jupyter notebook environment that requires no setup and runs entirely in the cloud and can be stored in your Google Drive. As Spark is a distributed data processing framework written in Scala and runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), it requires a Java runtime environment to run. Colab comes with a Java runtime environment pre-installed, so we can run Spark on Colab without any additional setup.

### Colaboratory

Read through and run the following Colab notebooks to get familiar with Colab:
